# The Invasion of the Opioid Crisis on Life in the US
## Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann

### Datasets
We plan to utilize the NSDUH primarily. Though we have not managed to successfully create a pandas table from this dataset, all of the data is accessible so this is more an issue of processing the data we have found into the right format. Though we have not managed to acquire other data yet, we would also like to look into policy if possible, specifically focusing on how policies in different countries have affected drug usage, drug-related crime, and/or drug-related deaths. In this respect, we have looked into UN datasets, although have not managed to find the exact data for which we would be looking.

For the NSDUH, the terms of use can be found here: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/info/terms-use-nid3422
In terms of ethical guidelines, the main guidelines center around keeping the research subjects private. We are not allowed to purposely seek to find the identity of participants or inadvertently reveal enough information about a specific subject so as to allow them to be identified.

### Explorations
We would like to explore the effect of the opioid epidemic on life in the US. Though we derived this idea from Allenâ€™s proposed project regarding the effect of the opioid epidemic on life expectancy, we would also like to explore the effects of the epidemic on other aspects of life as well. For instance, we would like to investigate how it has impacted different socioeconomic group, different states and areas of the country, and how it has changed with different policies.
