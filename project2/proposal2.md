# Datafest: Measuring Fatigue and Its Effects in Womens Rugby 7s
### Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann
#### Datasets
We plan to exclusively utilize the data provided to us by the Datafest challenge. For this challenge, we cannot reveal any information publicly until May 4. As a result, we have made our github repository private and added only those involved in creating and evaluating the project as collaborators.

#### Explorations
We intend to begin by exploring a great deal of the data provided to us by the datafest challenge before honing in on a smaller subset of the data as the project progresses. This will begin as a broad exploratory data analysis project and become more specific as we come up with intriguing questions to answer while exploring the data.
