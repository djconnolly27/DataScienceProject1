# Datafest: Measuring Fatigue and Its Effects in Womens Rugby 7s
### Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann
#### Datasets
We plan to exclusively utilize the data provided to us by the Datafest challenge. In terms of ethical concerns, for this challenge, we cannot reveal any information that might indicate the identities of the participants or the provider of the data publicly until May 4. As a result, we have made our github repository private and added only those involved in creating and evaluating the project as collaborators.

#### Explorations
We intend to begin by exploring a great deal of the data provided to us by the datafest challenge before honing in on a smaller subset of the data as the project progresses. This will begin as a broad exploratory data analysis project and become more specific as we come up with intriguing questions to answer while exploring the data.
