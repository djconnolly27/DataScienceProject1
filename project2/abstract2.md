### Health Metrics in Womens Rugby 7s
Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann

Have you ever wondered whether subjective intangibles such as fatigue, soreness, or sleep quality could be used to predict the outcomes of athletic competitions? Using an expansive dataset provided by Rugby Canada, we explore these questions and find that even our most comprehensive models have little predictive power in Women's Rugby 7s, especially considering most of their power could be due to random chance. This result suggests that, at the very least, the wellness factors provided are not strong measures of team success or game outcomes. Similarly, we test the anecdotally supported notion of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), which suggests muscle soreness is worst two days after a workout. We discover that the number of potential hits in which a player on the Canadian Women's Rugby 7s team is involved strongly predicts their future soreness, which peaks two days after the hits occur (r-squared=0.115). This data provides strong evidence of DOMS, suggesting the idea has statistical validity. Additionally, we find results and correlations that intuitively make sense, such as a strong relationship between sleep and fatigue.
