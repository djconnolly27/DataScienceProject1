### Health Metrics in Womens Rugby 7s
Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann

Have you ever wondered whether subjective intangibles such as fatigue, soreness, or sleep quality could be used to predict the outcomes of athletic competitions? Or whether those same metrics could be predicted by how much punishment a person takes, how hard they train, or what type of training they do? Well, after 2 weeks of working with data provided by the Canadian Womenâ€™s 7s Rugby team that gives us all of these metrics and more, we are still asking many of those questions! Using an expansive dataset provided by the DataFest Challenege, we explore many areas of interest, such as the relationship between wellness and workout duration. While we are not able to find anything definitely predictive of game outcomes, we find intriguing evidence of delayed onset muscle soreness and traverse a multitude of interesting paths that produce results and correlations that intuitively make sense. In fact, the number of potential hits a player is involved in during a game has a 12% effect on their soreness two days later.
