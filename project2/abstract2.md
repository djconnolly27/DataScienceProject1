#### Health Metrics in Womens Rugby 7s
Daniel Connolly and Bryce Mann

Have you ever wondered whether subjective intangibles such as fatigue, soreness, sleep quality, etc. could be used to predict the outcomes of athletic competitions? Or whether those same metrics could be predicted by how much punishment a person takes, how hard they train, or what type of training they do?

We explore many different lines of questioning and possible areas of interest in this expansive dataset, provided by the DataFest Challenge. While we are not able to find anything definitely predictive, we went down some interesting paths that produced significant results and correlations that intuitively make sense. This is hopefully a good starting point for a longer-term, more in depth analysis of these athletes’ data. [Read More](report.md)
