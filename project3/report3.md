# Tried and True: Regression Models sometimes beat Neural Networks
#### Daniel Connolly

Machine learning is a tool that is often talked about as a sort of black box which we can only peek into with great difficulty. Because the increasing complexity of models is only exacerbating this issue, I found it worthwhile to see how traditional regression models of machine learning measured up to more complicated neural networks. In particular, I investigate heart disease data provided by a [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/) called Machine Learning with a Heart in order to find how a variety of machine learning models measure up to one another in this specific instance. The data, however, originates with the UCI Machine Learning Repository's [Statlog heart dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29). In accordance with the repository's citation policy, I have linked to the page where I found the data. The dataset contains 13 explanatory variables ranging from the results of a thallium stress test to age, all of which are to be used in order to predict whether or not a person has heart disease.
