# Project 3 Proposal: Finding the Critical Temperature of Superconductors
### By Daniel Connolly

#### Dataset and Explorations

I will be using data initially from the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan which I found through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. After learning more about semiconductors in my other Electrical Engineering courses, I was intrigued by the potential to apply regression and deep learning techniques to real data regarding superconductors. The goal of this project, then, is primarily to apply these techniques in order to predict the critical temperature, or the temperature at which a material undergoes a transition into the superconducting state, of a variety of superconductors based on extracted data such as the atomic mass and thermal conductivity. Though the dataset does not explicitly mention this fact, I believe one motivation for modeling the critical temperature of a superconductor is to eventually predict the existence of room temperature superconductors.

#### Considerations

The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository states that the data is public, although because I am unable to read Japanese, I was unable to independently verify this on the NIMS site. Because the data does not deal with the private information of individuals, it is unlikely that there are many ethical considerations in investigating the overarching question of the critical temperature of superconductors.

#### Challenges

One challenge I have already run into is interpreting the values of the columns and the units of each values. I was able to find some information regarding this in an article linked to from the UCI website that is also responsible for providing the data in csv format: [Click here to read the article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025618304877?via%3Dihub).

#### Expansions

Should I have time, I would also like to investigate properties of semiconductors and their behavior using the same tools of machine learning and regression. Though I highly anticipate that I will not have time for this, I will keep it under consideration as I move forward, as it remains an interest of mine.
