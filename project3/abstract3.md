# Tried and True: When Regression Models beat Neural Networks

##### Daniel Connolly

As the complexity of machine learning models continues to increase with computational power, the tools of the trade, namely neural networks here, often become more and more difficult to understand. As a result, I perform a comparative study on the behavior of eight different regression models and one neural network model in order to examine the performance of each on a heart disease dataset. Using this heart disease data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I find that regression models tend to outperform neural networks in terms of accuracy when trying to predict heart disease based on the 13 features, ranging from age to max heart rate, provided [Read more](https://github.com/djconnolly27/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/project3/report3.md).
