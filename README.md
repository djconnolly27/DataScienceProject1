# DataScienceProjects
This repository contains the three projects on which I worked in Data Science during the spring semester of 2019. To learn more about the specifics of these projects, I suggest beginning with the abstracts of each project, which I will link to below.

Project 1 examines the Opioid Epidemic: [abstract](https://github.com/djconnolly27/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/project1/abstract1.md)

Project 2 examines Women's Rugby 7s data: [abstract](https://github.com/djconnolly27/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/project2/abstract2.md)

Project 3 examines machine learning models in the context of heart disease data: [abstract](https://github.com/djconnolly27/DataScienceProjects/blob/master/project3/abstract3.md)
